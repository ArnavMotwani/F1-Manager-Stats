## Description
This is a python script to compare the stats of drivers at specific levels in F1 manager by Hutch Games. It uses raw data by u/AGrecords on reddit. Which was shared in may 2020

## Installation
Clone this directory anywhere onto your machine

### Prerequisites / Dependencies 
This project runs on python 3 and requires the packages: openpyxl

## Usage
Run the **Search.py** file in either an IDE or your systems command line interface using python 3. Once youâ€™ve run the program and entered data at the prompts, a output.xlsx file will be created in the same directory as Search.py. 

You can open the FOneData file to see all the data as shared by the reddit user mentioned in the description. The file also has data on all the car parts in the game.

## Feature under development:
I am planning to add visualisation of the outputted data using Matplotlib. I will also develop the comparison of parts stats at a later date.
